# Decision Record: Development of Obsidian Plugin and Integration Strategies

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The need for a more integrated and efficient system to manage content and workflows within Obsidian was identified. The existing standalone application approach was deemed insufficient in providing seamless integration with tools like Google Calendar and Todo lists, leading to the exploration of alternative solutions.

## Decision

1. **Develop an Obsidian Plugin**: Instead of a standalone application, we'll create a plugin for Obsidian. By using the plugin we avoid content integration with external sources such as Google Calendar and Todo lists.
2. **Implement Client-Side Preprocessing**: Since we now have full access to the vault, We can reference the user's content like their brag sheet, priorities, strengths. The plugin will include preprocessing steps on the client side. This involves referencing other local vault wikipages and possibly incorporating features similar to the [Influx](https://github.com/jensmtg/influx) plugin, enriching the content of referenced notes with backlink sections.
3. **Establish a Server Proxy**: The server's initial role will be to serve as a proxy for ChatGPT. This setup will include preprocessing of input to enrich it with additional context and post-processing to refine the output.

## Consequences

- **Easier Integration and Management**: The development of an Obsidian plugin removes integration of external content sources, which other Obsidian Plugins already handle.
- **Enhanced Content Richness**: Preprocessing on the client side will allow for much richer context.
- **Simplify Development**: The implementation of client-side preprocessing and a server proxy for ChatGPT will simplify development. Multiple flows can be defined each with their own system instructions and user prompt.
- **Improved User Experience**: The plugin will be able to provide a more seamless experience for the user. They can add whatever context they deem necessary to the input or prompt and the plugin will handle the rest.
